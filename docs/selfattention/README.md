Attention and self-attention are both mechanisms in machine learning, particularly in neural networks for sequence processing (like transformers). Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

Attention

Purpose: Attention allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each output. It's helpful when each output token needs to attend to specific parts of the input.

Usage: Commonly used in sequence-to-sequence tasks, like machine translation, where the model attends to relevant words in the input sentence to generate each word in the output sentence.

How it Works: In standard encoder-decoder architectures, attention scores are calculated based on the similarity between the decoder state and each encoder state. This score indicates how much the model should "pay attention" to each input token for the current output token.


Self-Attention

Purpose: Self-attention enables each word in a sequence to relate to every other word within the same sequence, allowing the model to understand dependencies within the sequence itself.

Usage: Primarily used within transformers. Self-attention is employed in both encoder and decoder layers, allowing each token to learn contextual representations by attending to other tokens in the sequence.

How it Works: Self-attention computes a score for each pair of tokens in the sequence, enabling the model to understand relationships between words, like pronouns and their antecedents or interactions between words in a phrase.


Key Differences

Scope: Attention attends to another sequence (encoder-decoder), while self-attention attends within the same sequence (encoder or decoder alone).

Application: Attention often cross-references between input and output sequences, while self-attention enriches each token's understanding by cross-referencing other tokens within the same sequence.


In essence, self-attention is a type of attention applied within the same sequence, enabling rich contextual understanding within the sequence.

Let’s consider a concrete example with a simple sentence to illustrate the difference between attention and self-attention:

Example Sentence

Suppose the input sentence is:

> "The cat sat on the mat."



Let’s imagine we’re processing this sentence in two different contexts:

1. Attention (Cross-Attention) in a sequence-to-sequence model, like in a translation task where we translate from English to French.


2. Self-Attention within a single sequence, such as understanding word dependencies and relationships within this single sentence in a transformer encoder.



1. Attention (Cross-Attention) Example

Imagine we're translating this sentence into French. In the decoder, when generating each word in the output (French) sentence, the model uses attention to focus on specific parts of the input (English) sentence that are most relevant to the current output word.

Example Translation:

> "Le chat s'est assis sur le tapis."



For generating "Le" in the French sentence, the decoder will pay the most attention to "The" in the English sentence.

For generating "chat," it will pay the most attention to "cat."

When it reaches "tapis" (French for "mat"), it will attend to "mat" in the English sentence.


Here, attention helps the model to focus on the correct parts of the input sequence (English sentence) to generate the output sequence (French sentence).

2. Self-Attention Example

In self-attention, we’re processing the same English sentence to understand its internal dependencies. Each word in the sentence can attend to every other word, allowing it to capture relationships and context within the sentence itself.

Word Dependency Highlights:

For "cat," the model might give higher attention weights to "The" and "sat" to understand that "cat" is the subject that "sat."

For "sat," the model will likely attend to "cat" (to understand who sat) and "on" (for where it sat).

For "the mat," the model will pay attention to "sat on" to understand that "the mat" is the object being sat on.


In this case, self-attention enables the model to build a contextualized representation of each word by considering other words in the sentence. This is particularly useful in understanding which words are linked (e.g., "cat" and "sat," "sat" and "on the mat").

Summary

Attention (Cross-Attention): Helps map relevant words from the input sequence to generate the output sequence in tasks like translation.

Self-Attention: Enables each word to attend to others within the same sequence, creating context-rich representations of each word relative to the others. This is crucial for tasks like sentence understanding and classification.
