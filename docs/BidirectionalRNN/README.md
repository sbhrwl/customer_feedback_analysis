# Bidirectional RNN
- Bidirectional RNNs (BiRNNs) were developed to address some limitations of traditional RNNs and even LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) in certain applications. 
- Here are a few key reasons why BiRNNs became popular

## **Capturing Context from Both Directions**
- Traditional RNNs and LSTMs process sequences in a single direction (forward), meaning they only consider past context when making predictions. 
- BiRNNs, on the other hand, process the data in both directions (forward and backward), allowing the model to capture information from both past and future contexts. 
- This is particularly useful in tasks like **text processing**, where understanding the context before and after a word can provide more meaningful insights.

## **Improved Performance in Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**
- BiRNNs have shown improved performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as **machine translation**, **speech recognition**, and **text summarization**. 
- By considering both past and future context, BiRNNs can make more accurate predictions at each time step.

## **Enhanced Feature Extraction**
- In tasks like **sentiment analysis** or **named entity recognition**, BiRNNs can extract features more effectively by leveraging information from both directions. 
- This can lead to better model performance and more accurate results.

### **Example: Sentiment Analysis**
- Consider a sentence: "The movie was not bad, but the ending was disappointing."
- A unidirectional LSTM might miss the positive sentiment conveyed by "not bad" if it only looks at the context before "disappointing."
- A BiRNN, however, would capture both "not bad" and "disappointing," providing a more balanced understanding of the sentiment.

### **Implementation**
- BiRNNs can be implemented using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, where you can stack LSTM layers in both directions and concatenate their outputs.
