# LSTM

## Bais initialisation
- Weights are initialised as 1 (instead of 0 in ANNs and other ML models)
- Initialising BIAS with 0 for RNN will result in totally discarding values
- for RNN Initialise `BIAS` with 1, because in LSTM we think about memory, so we would want to remeber initial values as well
