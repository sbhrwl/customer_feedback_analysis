# Bidirectional RNN
- Bidirectional RNNs (BiRNNs) were developed to address some limitations of traditional RNNs and even LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) in certain applications. 
- Here are a few key reasons why BiRNNs became popular

## **Capturing Context from Both Directions**
- Traditional RNNs and LSTMs process sequences in a single direction (forward), meaning they only consider past context when making predictions. 
- BiRNNs, on the other hand, process the data in both directions (forward and backward), allowing the model to capture information from both past and future contexts. 
- This is particularly useful in tasks like **text processing**, where understanding the context before and after a word can provide more meaningful insights.

## **Improved Performance in Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**
- BiRNNs have shown improved performance in sequence-to-sequence tasks such as **machine translation**, **speech recognition**, and **text summarization**. 
- By considering both past and future context, BiRNNs can make more accurate predictions at each time step.

## **Enhanced Feature Extraction**
- In tasks like **sentiment analysis** or **named entity recognition**, BiRNNs can extract features more effectively by leveraging information from both directions. 
- This can lead to better model performance and more accurate results.

### **Example: Sentiment Analysis**
- Consider a sentence: "The movie was not bad, but the ending was disappointing."
- A unidirectional LSTM might miss the positive sentiment conveyed by "not bad" if it only looks at the context before "disappointing."
- A BiRNN, however, would capture both "not bad" and "disappointing," providing a more balanced understanding of the sentiment.

### **Implementation**
- BiRNNs can be implemented using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, where you can stack LSTM layers in both directions and concatenate their outputs.

## Illustration
- To illustrate the difference in performance between an RNN and an LSTM, let's consider a practical example of a text prediction task. We'll use a dataset of Shakespeare's works to train both models and compare their ability to generate text.

### **Dataset**
We'll use a text dataset containing Shakespeare's works. The task is to predict the next character in a sequence.

### **RNN Model**
Here's a simple implementation of an RNN in TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, SimpleRNN, Dense

# Sample data preparation
# Let's assume 'x_train' and 'y_train' are preprocessed sequences of text

model_rnn = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=64),
    SimpleRNN(128, return_sequences=True),
    SimpleRNN(128),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

model_rnn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
model_rnn.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

### **LSTM Model**
Here's a simple implementation of an LSTM for the same task:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense

# Sample data preparation
# Let's assume 'x_train' and 'y_train' are preprocessed sequences of text

model_lstm = Sequential([
    Embedding(input_dim=vocab_size, output_dim=64),
    LSTM(128, return_sequences=True),
    LSTM(128),
    Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax')
])

model_lstm.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
model_lstm.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10)
```

### **Performance Comparison**
- After training both models, we can evaluate their performance by generating some text and comparing the results.

#### **RNN Generated Text**
- Let's say the RNN generated this text snippet after being trained:

```
"To be or not to be, that is the questione thing is"
```

#### **LSTM Generated Text**
The LSTM generated this text snippet after being trained:

```
"To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind"
```

### **Comparison of Results**

- **Quality of Text**: The LSTM-generated text is more coherent and captures the structure of Shakespeare's language better than the RNN-generated text.
- **Handling Long-Term Dependencies**: The LSTM is better at maintaining context over longer sequences, which helps in generating more meaningful text.

### **Conclusion**
- The LSTM outperforms the RNN in this text prediction task by generating more accurate and contextually relevant sequences. 
- This is because LSTMs are designed to handle long-term dependencies and mitigate issues like the vanishing gradient problem, which traditional RNNs struggle with.
